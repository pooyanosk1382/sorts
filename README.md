# sorts
code of insertion sort, bubble sort, counting sort, selection sort, merge sort, bucket sort, binary search, lower bound, upper bound, and intro sort in python
also it has comments in the beginning of each code that explain about the algorithm

Insertion sort:

Insertion sort works similar to the sorting of playing cards in hands. It is assumed that the first card is already sorted in the card game, and then we select an unsorted card. If the selected unsorted card is greater than the first card, it will be placed at the right side; otherwise, it will be placed at the left side. Similarly, all unsorted cards are taken and put in their exact place.
