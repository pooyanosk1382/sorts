# sorts
code of insertion sort, bubble sort, counting sort, selection sort, merge sort, bucket sort, binary search, lower bound, upper bound, and intro sort in python
also it has comments in the beginning of each code that explain about the algorithm

Insertion sort:

Insertion sort works similar to the sorting of playing cards in hands. It is assumed that the first card is already sorted in the card game, and then we select an unsorted card. If the selected unsorted card is greater than the first card, it will be placed at the right side; otherwise, it will be placed at the left side. Similarly, all unsorted cards are taken and put in their exact place.

Bubble sort:

Bubble sort works on the repeatedly swapping of adjacent elements until they are not in the intended order. It is called bubble sort because the movement of array elements is just like the movement of air bubbles in the water. Bubbles in water rise up to the surface; similarly, the array elements in bubble sort move to the end in each iteration.

Counting sort:

This sorting technique doesn't perform sorting by comparing elements. It performs sorting by counting objects having distinct key values like hashing. After that, it performs some arithmetic operations to calculate each object's index position in the output sequence. Counting sort is not used as a general-purpose sorting algorithm.

Selection sort:

In selection sort, the smallest value among the unsorted elements of the array is selected in every pass and inserted to its appropriate position into the array. It is also the simplest algorithm. It is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. In this algorithm, the array is divided into two parts, first is sorted part, and another one is the unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part of the array is empty, and unsorted part is the given array. Sorted part is placed at the left, while the unsorted part is placed at the right.
